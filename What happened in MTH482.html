 <h1> Everything that has happened to us in the switch to Python/ machine learning process</h1>
  <hr/>
 <h2>Getting the proper equipment</h2>
  <p> This whole process has most definitely been an interesting journey. First I thought I was going to be taking a excel 
      file class, unknowingly things changed to becoming a coding class, which I have to add was absolutely excited for.
      Once we beganthe process of learning the basics to python and installing the correct version, my first immediate 
      <em>obstacle</em> was having to get a working laptop that could run the soft ware necessaryfor the class. Initially I 
      thought my tablet was going to work, infact I even got a program downloaded on to my tablet. Unfortunetly that program
      was only a simulator and I couldn't save my work. So next I had to borrow my sister's laptop.
  <br/> 
 <h2>Once I had a Laptop</h2>
  <p> Getting the laptop wasn't difficult, it was installing the modules that proved to be interesting. The modules that seemed 
      to not want to install correctly were Scipy, Numpy and Skitlearn. In order for me to solve this issue I had to manually 
      install them into python by retrieving them from the internet. It took a great length of time to find the correct process 
      to fix this issue, but it eventually wored and I was able to show the way for the rest of the Window users.
